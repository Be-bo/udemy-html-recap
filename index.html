    <h1>Hello there!</h1>
    <h2>I'm Robert and this is my first website in a while</h2>
    <p>As you can see I'm just blabbering on for the hell of it. Didn't want to make this originally, brrrr <br />
    But I figured I'd do it anyway as a way to get comfortable with my web dev envo through practice.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>This is number 1</li>
        <li>This is number 2</li>
        <li>This is number 3</li>
    </ol>

    <a href="https://www.apple.ca">My Favorite Website</a>
    <a href="./image.html">Local site containing an image</a>
